# New-YakeTimer
New-Timer, with a twist.

Long ago, I wrote [a small PowerShell CMDLet called New-Timer](https://gist.github.com/XPlantefeve/cedf72a328e894cdc2d2974d3f437a94).

This is a new version, thanks to an idea [CommiCOzzy](https://www.reddit.com/user/ComicOzzy) [gave me on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/a4u7hv/whats_the_most_impressive_thing_youve_managed_to/)

Please update the wav path on the script first line appropriatly.
